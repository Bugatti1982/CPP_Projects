This is only for educational purposes to showcase what concepts I have learned.
This should not be used for usage of answers on tests nor should it be used for work that someone else has not done.

What are these projects? How did it get made?
---------------------------------------------
These are currently projects that I am developing from a C++ course that is still in progress. These bring on great examples of problem solving and utilizing information effectively.

How does it work?
-----------------
These scripts include code to form local tables and queries. They utilize a range of techniques such as conditional statements, classes, structs, loops, pointers, headers, functions,etc.

What are the requirements? How do I run it?
-------------------------------------------
I'm currently running these scripts using Visual Studio 2022. Simply download the project of choice by chosing the solution file to open the entire project.
This will include everything including headers and source files.
