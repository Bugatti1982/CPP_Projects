DISCLAIMER:
---------------------------------------------
This is only for educational purposes to showcase what concepts I have learned.
This should not to be used for usage of answers on tests nor should it be used for work that someone else has not done.

What are these projects? How did it get made? What will these be used for?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are currently projects that I am developing from a C++ course that is still in progress. These bring on great examples of problem solving and utilizing information effectively. Eventually, these concepts will be used to develop my own custom game engine using OpenGL as the API renderer of choice. Right now this is used to refresh my memory of C++ before moving on to advanced topics.

How does it work?
-----------------
These projects include code to utilize a range of techniques such as conditional statements, classes, structs, loops, pointers, headers, functions,etc.

What are the requirements? How do I run it?
-------------------------------------------
I'm currently running these projects using Visual Studio 2022. To open a project, simply download the project of choice and chose the solution file contained inside of the project to open the entire project.
This will include everything including headers and source files.
